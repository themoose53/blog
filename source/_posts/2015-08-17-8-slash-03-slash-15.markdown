##Three basic things you need for a webpage

In order to have a decent webpage, you'll need to include three things. These things are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

##HTML

Html is the foundation of your webpage. It includes all of the content in your page.

##CSS

CSS is just as important as HTML. CSS will make your webpages look good. It also determines the position of elements.

##JavaScript

JavaScript is what makes your webpage more interactive. You can use JavaScript to load parts of your page without reloading the entire page (Ajax).
